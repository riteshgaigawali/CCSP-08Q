/*

- The packages in Java are like folders/directories, and are called as libraries as well.
- Java 8 supports 14 predifined packages.

	* User-defined packages :

- To create an user-defined package we have to use the keyword called as 'package'.
- Every package will have a package-name, to create a package-name each and every letter should be in lower-case, it is not mandatory but a proffessional practice.

- Syntax : package package-name;
	       Ex. package cyber;

- To compile following program : 

>> javac -d . Filename.java

	javac --> to call the Java compiler
	-d --> to create a directory structure
	. --> represent in current directory
	Filename.java --> the actual Java source-code filename.
