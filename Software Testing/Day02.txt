# Selenium Components

1. **Selenium IDE (v1.0)**:
   - Simplest framework in the Selenium suite, easy to learn.
   - It is a Firefox plugin that can be installed easily from the web store.
   - It is a record-and-playback tool, but it has inconsistent results during execution, which is why Selenium RC or WebDriver is preferred for web automation.

2. **Selenium RC (Remote Control) (v2.0)**:
   - A testing framework used primarily for automating web applications.
   - It was the first tool to support multiple programming languages (Java, Python, Ruby, .NET, PHP, C#, etc.).
   - Selenium RC has a strong dependency on a stand-alone server, which must be installed to automate web apps using Selenium RC.
   - This dependency was overcome in the next version, Selenium WebDriver.

3. **Selenium WebDriver (v3.0)**:
   - A stable version combining Selenium RC and WebDriver functionalities.
   - Supports various programming languages similar to Selenium RC.
   - WebDriver is compatible with different platforms and browsers.

4. **Selenium Grid (v4.0)**:
   - A tool used in conjunction with Selenium RC and WebDriver to run parallel automation tests across multiple machines and browsers simultaneously.
   - Requires connecting multiple machines in a network (e.g., LAN) for test execution.
