 Limitations of an Array :
 
 	- Arrays do not support the concept of predefined methods, hence the operations will become complex.
 	- Arrays will still consume memory whether you store values or do not store values.
 	- Arrays are fixed in size and cannot increase/decrease during the runtime.
 	- Hence to overcome this Limitations of an Array we go for Collections.
 	
 Collections :
 
 	- Collections can be defined as a set of classes and interfaces which are meant to store and manipulate the data.
 	- All collection classes are part of java.util package.
 	- Collection in a simple way are nothing but an extension of an Array.
 	- In Collections we can store not only one particular type of data but we can also store multiple type of data(homogeneous & heterogeneous).
 	- Collections are categorize mainly into three types :
 		1) Lists Collections
 		2) Sets Collections
 		3) Maps Collections
 	
 	#1. Lists Collections :
 		
 						Collection(I) v1.2
 						       |
 						     List(I) v1.2
 						       |
 		-----------------------------------------------
        |                      |                      |
  ArrayList(C) v1.2      LinkedList(C) v1.2       Vector(C) v1.2
                                                      |
                                                   Stack(C) v1.2
