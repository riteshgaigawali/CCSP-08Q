/*
- While creating a variable :-
1. We need to declare a variable.
2. We need to initialize the variable.

- While using the variable we can declare it in the one line and initialize it in the same line, also we can declare in one line and initialize it in another line.

- First time when we give a value to a variable it is called as initialization, and second, third time when we give value to the same variable that is called as assignment.

- Comments are used by developers to inform other developers, the use of code or statement within the program. They are never part of compilation or execution.
